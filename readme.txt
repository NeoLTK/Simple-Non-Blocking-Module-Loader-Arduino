Simple and non-blocking Arduino module loader, configurable as a Malin type firmware (3d printer firmware), and compatible with any Arduino, I run it on an Arduino nano

created for my personal use without pretension, but it can be used by others, some modules are not finished. the main one is the management of modules when it is finished in the very first version, of course to optimize

If you followed the same principle, you could add any module without modifying the base
